		  	Dear Mayor <span> </span> and Councilpeople <span> </span>, <span> </span>, and <span> </span>,</p>

			<p>I am a resident of <span> </span> and I am getting in touch because I am deeply troubled by what I have seen recently of the treatment of Black Americans by police in police departments nationwide. I would like to know what kinds of safeguards our town's police department has in place to prevent incidents of racism by police.</p>

			<p>Are <span> </span> PD required to wear body cameras to record their responses to calls on video? Does the department perform any kind of anti-racism training for officers? Are new recruits screened in any way to prevent the hiring of racists, for instance through looking at social media posts? How does internal affairs investigate and respond to reports of discrimination against officers?</p>

			<p>If these safeguards are not in place, they certainly should be, and I would support my local taxes paying to fund these interventions.</p>

			<p>Thank you for your attention to my concerns. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

	<p>Dear Senator <span> </span> and Representatives <span> </span> and <span> </span>,</p>

<p>I am a resident of <span> </span> in <span> </span> County and I am getting in touch because I am deeply troubled by what I have seen recently of the treatment of Black Americans by police in police departments nationwide. I would like to know what kinds of safeguards our town's police department has in place to prevent incidents of racism by police. </p>

<p>Are local and county PD required to wear body cameras to record their responses to calls on video? Do departments perform any kind of anti-racism training for officers? Are new recruits screened in any way to prevent the hiring of racists, for instance through looking at social media posts? How does internal affairs investigate and respond to reports of discrimination against police officers?</p>

<p>Most importantly, how do county and state-wide agencies hold local police departments accountable to ensure incidences of racist violence by police are not simply swept under the rug?</p>

<p>If these safeguards are not in place, they certainly should be, and I would support my local taxes paying to fund these interventions. </p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to my concerns. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>
