		  	Dear Mayor <span> </span> and Councilpeople <span> </span>, <span> </span>, and <span> </span>,</p>

			<p>I am a resident of <span> </span> and I am getting in touch because I am deeply troubled by what I have seen recently of the treatment of Black Americans by police in police departments nationwide. I would like to know what kinds of safeguards our town's police department has in place to prevent incidents of racism by police.</p>

			<p>Are <span> </span> PD required to wear body cameras to record their responses to calls on video? Does the department perform any kind of anti-racism training for officers? Are new recruits screened in any way to prevent the hiring of racists, for instance through looking at social media posts?

			<p>If these safeguards are not in place, they certainly should be, and I do not support my local taxes paying to fund a police department that perpetuates racism and violence. Services I would rather see funded include: mental health professionals, crisis de-escalators, support for those suffering domestic abuse and addiction in our community, to name only a few.   </p>

			<p>Thank you for your attention to my concerns. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

	<b>An email script for continue to push after an inadequate response from officials</b>

	<p>Dear Mayor <span> </span> and Representatives <span> </span> and <span> </span>,</p>

<p>This is <span> </span> emailing again to continue a conversation about policing in <span> </span>. I read the police chief’s statement and the language resonated with me but ultimately I do not feel satisfied until I see that our town is committed to translating the Chief’s words and intentions into actions. </p>

<p>Organizations currently working towards the end of racist police violence advocate two approaches to solving the problem: the first are reforms, the second is divesting from the police budget and reinvesting that money into alternatives to policing for our community’s health and safety. I do not believe the two are mutually exclusive and that our community should be doing both. With that in mind, allow me to direct you to the websites of two organizations, one advocating for police reform, the other for divestment. </p>

<p>Campaign Zero advocates for the demilitarization of policing, the improvement of training, and body cameras, some of which I mentioned in my prior email. I personally know people (some Black, some white) who have experienced police harassment in <span> </span>, which indicates to me that reform has not been a successful approach here. Our police department continues to hire bullies and racists and then arms them and pays for unnecessary equipment. I remember in middle school my DARE officer Gary Moore drove a police car with special lights and butterfly doors. I consider this a total waste of tax money that would better be invested elsewhere. </p>

<p>On which note, I refer you to MPD150, a Minneapolis organization advocating for divestment from police budgets and reinvestment into alternatives to policing on a variety of issues property crime, domestic violence, drugs, and traffic stops. Since domestic violence and traffic stops are the major responsibilities of police officers in our town, we should definitely look into alternatives to policing on these issues.</p> 

<p>As for domestic violence, it is certainly worth it to fund extra counseling support for victims of domestic abuse, as it is insufficient for officers to simply subdue the abuser. The National Center for Women & Policing reports that domestic abuse is 4x as prevalent within police households than within the general population, which further makes me question whether the money we allocate to stop domestic violence is actually being spent effectively when we spend it on police.</p>

<p>As for traffic violations, I personally have been harassed by traffic police for doing nothing but driving at night, and it does not make me feel safe to see armed officers parked around the town with bright lights all night. <span> </span> has a higher police presence than other local towns, for instance <span> </span>, and I consider it a waste of money to fund so much nighttime traffic policing. It is also a sign of lazy town budgeting to rely on the income of traffic violations to fund our town budget. Also on the topic of traffic stops, the police are not really qualified to enforce traffic safety because of their use of bronze medallions, medallions distributed by police to family that indicate they are part of the police “community”. I know several <span> </span> residents personally who use such medallions to get a free pass on violations. This is blatantly corrupt. Rather than fund the police, I would prefer our tax money go to unarmed traffic monitors who do not give a free pass to family members.</p>

<p>Regardless of the police chief’s words, ultimately <span> </span> has a reputation for being a racist town that is not welcoming to Black people or immigrants. I know the experiences of my Black friends and leaders within <span> </span> attest that this reputation for racism is not merely a stereotype, but a real fact of our community’s culture. I find that unacceptable. If you don’t find it unacceptable, quite frankly, your racism disqualifies you from truly serving the community and you should not be working at any level of government.</p>

<p>That is why I believe our community, led by you as our elected leaders, needs to prioritize researching the work of Campaign Zero and MPD150 and implementing it here in our town. If we don’t commit to setting an example for racial justice through a combination of police reform, divestment, and anti-racism education efforts for our majority white population about ending racism, then we will continue to be a racist town that wastes its tax money on an unreliable, corrupt, and inadequately trained police department. Since I know these ideas may be new to you, I am happy to guide you in the research that will be necessary to implement the reforms our town—and our state as a whole— desperately needs. Until we do so, not only will our town retain its unfortunate reputation, it will also never truly be a safe community. Thank you for your attention to my words— I  hope you take them seriously. </p>

<p>Signed, <span> </span> </p>
